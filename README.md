# 🏥 Doctor Referral System

## 📘 Overview
The **Doctor Referral System** is a web-based platform designed to streamline communication and collaboration between **patients**, **general practitioners**, and **specialist doctors**.

The system simplifies the referral process by documenting every patient interaction, referral, and test with **timestamps** while ensuring data security and accessibility. It incorporates an **AI assistant** that interacts with patients upon sign-in, collects their symptoms and history, and organizes the information neatly for doctors to review — **without performing any diagnosis**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Improve coordination between doctors and specialists.  
- Allow structured, timestamped documentation of patient interactions.  
- Ensure patient data security and controlled access via authentication.  
- Integrate an AI assistant for patient data collection and organization.  
- Store and manage all data in a PostgreSQL database.  
- Deploy a fully functional web app using Vercel (frontend) and an online backend host.

## 🧩 System Architecture

### **Frontend**
- Built with **Next.js** and hosted on **Vercel**.  
- User roles: Patient, Doctor, Admin.  
- Interactive dashboards for communication and record viewing.

### **Backend**
- Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
- RESTful API endpoints for authentication, patient management, and referrals.  
- Integrated with **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage.

### **Database (PostgreSQL)**
**Core Tables:**
- **Users:** Stores login info and user roles (patient/doctor/admin).  
- **Patients:** Contains personal info and medical history.  
- **Doctors:** Contains doctor details and specialties.  
- **Referrals:** Logs all referrals and statuses with timestamps.  
- **Logs:** Records every system action for traceability.  

### **AI Assistant**
- Initiates the first conversation with patients.  
- Collects and structures symptom details and visit reasons.  
- Automatically timestamps and saves data to the database.  
- Does **not** diagnose or give medical advice.
